Quick mod made For Rycon for his innawoods playthrough. Haven't figured out how to make the action of gathering take longer, or be more exerting if you know how share.
Concept is you use sticks, and ropes to make an a-frame over the well in order to raise and lower the "bucket" down to keep it from scraping the sides of the well, or smashing, and to make it a little easier.
